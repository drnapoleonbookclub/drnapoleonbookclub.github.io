<p>"Well ladies and gentlemen, that time has come. We have a beautiful deliberation room set up for you with comfortable seating and a mini-refrigerator filled with soft drinks and water for you. If you need anything you may buzz the bailiff who will be stationed outside of the deliberation room during the process."</p>
<br />
<p>"Please now retire to the deliberation room and begin the process."</p>
